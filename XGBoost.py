class Node:
    
    '''
    A node object that is recursivly called within itslef to construct a regression tree. Based on Tianqi Chen's XGBoost 
    the internal gain used to find the optimal split value uses both the gradient and hessian. Also a weighted quantlie sketch 
    and optimal leaf values all follow Chen's description in "XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System" the only thing not 
    implemented in this version is sparsity aware fitting or the ability to handle NA values with a default direction.

    Inputs
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    x: pandas datframe of the training data
    gradient: negative gradient of the loss function
    hessian: second order derivative of the loss function
    idxs: used to keep track of samples within the tree structure
    subsample_cols: is an implementation of layerwise column subsample randomizing the structure of the trees
    (complexity parameter)
    min_leaf: minimum number of samples for a node to be considered a node (complexity parameter)
    min_child_weight: sum of the heassian inside a node is a meaure of purity (complexity parameter)
    depth: limits the number of layers in the tree
    lambda: L2 regularization term on weights. Increasing this value will make model more conservative.
    gamma: This parameter also prevents over fitting and is present in the the calculation of the gain (structure score). 
    As this is subtracted from the gain it essentially sets a minimum gain amount to make a split in a node.
    eps: This parameter is used in the quantile weighted skecth or 'approx' tree method roughly translates to 
    (1 / sketch_eps) number of bins

    Outputs
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A single tree object that will be used for gradient boosintg.
